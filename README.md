# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This library management system revolves around a book store-“The book bundle”. This is an administrative end application which allows the administrator to keep track of available and rented books as well as their customers who are currently in membership and also old members of the library and keeps their details for security purposes. The main objective of this project is to reduce the manual work of the librarian and to organize books in an understandable and easily recoverable method. It also provided reports on the store’s books and it’s customers that helps the administrator to keep tract of due books and calculates the fine to be paid by the customer if returned later than due date automatically. The status of an issued book remains rented until the particular book is returned and those books by logic cannot be available for other customers.
